Ontario is reporting 11,352 COVID  cases on Tuesday, as hospitalizations and those in ICUs
continue to rise. The provincial case total now stands at 816,450.



Over the last three days, there were 13,578 new infections on Monday, 16,714 reported on Sunday, and a record-breaking 18,445 new
cases on Saturday. However, due to recent testing eligibility changes the province warns the counts are an underestimate of the
true spread of the virus in the community.

Of the 11,352 new cases recorded, the data showed 1,647 were unvaccinated people, 445 were partially vaccinated people, 9,040 were
fully vaccinated people and for 219 people the vaccination status was unknown.

For the regional breakdown, 2,480 cases were recorded in Toronto, 1,486 in Peel Region, 1,059 in York Region, 635 in Durham
Region, and 612 in Waterloo. All other local public health units reported fewer than 600 new cases in the provincial report.

HOSPITALIZATIONS IN ONTARIO

Ontario reported 1,290 people in general hospital wards with COVID-19 (up by 58 from the previous day) with 266 patients in
intensive care units (up by 18).

Hospitalizations and those in ICUs continue to rise daily as Ontario grapples to contain Omicron.

For comparison, in the third wave peak in April which was the worst wave for hospitalizations, the province saw almost 2,400
patients in general hospital wards and as many as 900 patients in ICUs with COVID among a population that was vastly unvaccinated.

The death toll in the province has risen to 10,239 as 10 more virus-related deaths were reported.

As of 8 p.m. on Monday, there are more than 11.4 million people fully immunized with two doses, which is 88.2 per cent of the aged
12 and older population. First dose coverage stands at 90.9 per cent.

The province administered 148,577 doses in the last day. There are more than 3.8 million Ontarians who have received a booster
shot.

For young children aged five to 11, first dose coverage stands at 44.1 per cent with 1.7 per cent who are now fully vaccinated.

Meanwhile, 672,081 Ontario residents were reported to have recovered from COVID-19 , which is
82 per cent of known cases. Resolved cases increased by 7,519  from the previous day.

Active cases in Ontario now stand at 134,130 — up from last week when it was at 70,391. At the peak of the second wave in January,
active cases hit just above 30,000. In the third wave in April, active cases topped 43,000.

The seven-day average has now reached 14,435 as daily case counts due to Omicron continue to hover around unprecedented highs.

The government said 49,737 tests were processed in the previous 24 hours. There are 93,449 tests currently under investigation.

Test positivity hit 30.9 per cent meaning almost 1 in 3 tests are coming back positive for COVID. Last week, test positivity was
at 24.9 per cent.

However, Ontario officials have recently changed testing eligibility
 for those seeking to get a PCR test to
detect COVID-19 to only the most high-risk populations such as health care, long-term care, those who live and work in congregate
settings, etc.
